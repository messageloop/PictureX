PictureX can quickly and automatically erase the background of a picture, you can select specified objects, people and other targets you want to get from your surroundings, or you can select photos from your album to get the desired target object. You can use the background erased objects to save them to your own photo album. The use of this image is not limited to presentations, product images for e-commerce websites, ID photos or on social networking sites.

We use the most advanced artificial intelligence algorithms for background removal, all the algorithmic logic is done entirely on your personal iPhone or iPad.

All image data is on your personal iPhone or personal iPad and does not need to be submitted to a cloud server to participate in the calculation.

This protects the security of your data and your personal privacy from the source.
